    <p>Atlantic Money is intended to be a simple, easy to use REST based money tracking application. It will facilitate both the tracking of transactions</p>
    <p>through a web page, and it will eventually facilitate the tracking of wallet expenditure, by means of a smart phone application.</p>
    <p>This application will also leverage OCR technology to read receipts and upload this to the server.</p>
